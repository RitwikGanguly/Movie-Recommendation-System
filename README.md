# Movie-Recommendation-System
- This is an application where if the user enter a movie it will recommend 5 most prefarable movies for the user, that he/she can watch.
- In this project raw data is taken from **IMDB** by **Web Scraping** and cleaning the data by **Pandas** library and preprocessed to get our aimed dataset.
- Then **Plotly** is used to give the dataset a attractive insight by the visualizations.
- Then by the **Content based NLP** the model is trained for test.
- Last but not the least **Streamlit** is used to frame this in a web version.

> THE GREATER VERSION OF THIS IS ALSO MADE, WHERE WE USED HTML, CSS, DJANGO FOR WEB DESIGNING,
